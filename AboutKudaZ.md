In addition to my Python skills, I also have experience in game development using C# and Unity. I love the challenge of creating engaging and immersive games, and I'm always looking for new ways to push the boundaries of what's possible in game development.

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies and tinkering with hardware. I'm love learning new things and expanding my skill set, and I'm always excited to take on new projects and challenges.
